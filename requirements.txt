# Requirements for the Streamlit audio/text demo in app.py
# Notes:
# - pydub requires ffmpeg/avlib installed on the system (not a Python package).
#   On Windows, download ffmpeg and add it to PATH: https://ffmpeg.org/
# - speech_recognition uses online Google Web Speech API by default (no API key required
#   for small/demo use). For offline/local recognition you may need additional engines.

streamlit>=1.20
gTTS>=2.3.0
SpeechRecognition>=3.8.1
pydub>=0.25.1

# Optional (if you plan to load or manipulate audio in numpy or use advanced audio
# processing):
# numpy>=1.24
