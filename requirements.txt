# Requirements for the Streamlit Unstructured Data Analysis app
# Notes:
# - pydub requires ffmpeg/avlib installed on the system (not a Python package).
#   On Windows, download ffmpeg and add it to PATH: https://ffmpeg.org/
# - speech_recognition uses online Google Web Speech API by default (no API key required
#   for small/demo use). For offline/local recognition you may need additional engines.
# - nltk will download required data (punkt, stopwords) automatically on first run
