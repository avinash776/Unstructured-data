### 2. 👤 Face Detection
**Detects human faces using OpenCV**
- Uses Haar Cascade Classifier
- Draws green bounding boxes around faces
- Reports face count, position, and size
- Works with multiple faces

**Example Output:**
```
✅ Found 2 face(s) in the image!
[Image with green boxes around faces]

Face Details:
- Face 1: Position (320, 145), Size 180x180 pixels

- Counts instances of each object type

**Example Output:**
```
✅ Detected 8 object(s)!
[Image with labeled bounding boxes]

Detected Objects:

**Example Output:**
```
Predicted Age: 28 years
Predicted Gender: Female (Confidence: 94.3%)
Predicted Emotion: 😊 Happy (Confidence: 87.6%)

All Emotion Probabilities:
{
  "happy": "87.6%",
  "neutral": "8.3%",
  "surprise": "2.1%",
  "sad": "1.2%",
  "angry": "0.5%",
  "fear": "0.2%",
  "disgust": "0.1%"
}
```

**Emotions Detected:**
- 😊 Happy
- 😢 Sad
- 😠 Angry
- 😲 Surprise
- 😨 Fear
- 🤢 Disgust
- 😐 Neutral

**First Run:** Downloads DeepFace models (~100MB+) automatically

**Best Results:** Use clear, frontal face images

**Use Cases:**

### 5. 🖼️ Background Removal
**AI-powered background removal using Rembg (U²-Net)**
- Removes background automatically
- Isolates foreground subjects
- Produces transparent PNG
- Optional: Replace background with custom image

**Example Output:**
```
[Image with transparent background]
✅ Background removed successfully!

Optional: Replace Background
[Upload background image button]
[Replace Background button]
```

**First Run:** Downloads U²-Net model (~50MB) automatically

**Bonus Feature:** After removal, you can upload a new background image and click "Replace Background" to composite them together!

**Use Cases:**

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### For Face Detection:
✅ Use clear, well-lit images
✅ Faces should be visible and frontal
✅ Works with multiple faces
❌ Avoid extreme angles or occlusions

### For Object Detection:
✅ Use clear images with good lighting
✅ Objects should be reasonably sized
✅ Works best with common objects
❌ Very small objects may be missed

### For Age/Gender/Emotion:
✅ Clear, frontal face required
✅ Good lighting is essential
✅ Single face works best
❌ Profiles or obscured faces won't work well

### For Background Removal:
✅ Clear subject-background separation
✅ Solid or simple backgrounds work best
✅ Well-defined edges
❌ Complex backgrounds may have artifacts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No faces detected"
**Solution:** Ensure face is clearly visible and frontal. Try a different image with better lighting.

### "Error during object detection"
**Solution:** Wait for model to download on first run. Check internet connection. Restart app.

### "Model download failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check internet connection
2. Retry after a few minutes
3. Manually install: `pip install ultralytics deepface rembg`

### "Out of memory"
**Solution:**
1. Close other applications
2. Reduce image size before upload
3. Restart Streamlit app
4. Process images one at a time

### App is slow/stuck
**Solution:**
1. First run downloads models (be patient)
2. Large images take longer (resize to <2MB)
3. Check terminal for progress messages
4. Restart app if truly frozen
